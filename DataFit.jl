#1. Enter the gradientDescentBB functions from the textbook. Add them to your module

#2. Write a function called bestFitLine that minimizes equation (1) for a given set of data using the Barzilaiâ€“Borwein gradient descent code in problem #1. The only input should be a XYData object and should return a named tuple or a new datatype. Add the function to your module.
#function bestFitLine(XYData::XYData)

#4. consider a function of the form f(x;a,b,c) = ae^(bx) + C. You can write a best fit function for this by minimizing:


#Write a function called bestFitExponential that uses either the gradient descent from #1 or the functions
#from the JuMP module to find the minimum of (3).

#5. Write a test for your bestFitExponential function that uses a set of data that is generated from an exponential function and it should fit (fairly close) the given function.

#6. Write a function similar to that in #4 to minimize a periodic function of the form
